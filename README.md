a simple writeup /installer script to use android Devices and a UI for KlipperScreen for RaspberryPI
Thanks to JHS on the Klipper Forums for most of his code

How to Use Android Device as a KlipperScreen UI Permanently over WIFI

**Step 1** 
Download and install Klipper Screen Via Kiuah https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh

**Step 2**
Download and install XSDL and Configure.

  Android can use the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=x.org.server&hl=en_US&gl=US
  
  Fire Devices need to Sideload APK called x.org.server.apk listed in the data folder (uploading shortly however here is a direct download link) This version IS required for Fire devices
  
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/libsdl-android/files/apk/XServer-XSDL/XServer-XSDL-1.11.40.apk/download
  
  After Install open app Youll see SDL splash screen click “CHANGE DEVICE CONFIGURATION” 
Click Mouse Emulation the Mouse Emulation Mode then Select Desktop, No Emulation


**Step 3** 
Setup ADB on your PI
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb
```
Ensure device has Android Debugging enabled
For reference look up your device and how to enable android debugging
- FOR WIFI USAGE ENABLE WIRELESS ADB  and connect to the same WIFI network that your pi is on aka if your PI is hardwired make sure you connect to THE SAME ROUTER/NETWORK-

connect android device via USB to PI
go into your androids wifi settings to pull ip or use the blue screen fron the XSDL app to get your IP example 192.168.1.23 ONLY THESE NUMBERS do NOT put the :4713!!!

```
adb tcpip 5555
adb connect (IP ADDRESS)
adb shell
```
this is to confirm that you have wireless shell access 
go ahead and exit shell
verify you can see your device before the next step!!!
```
adb devices
```

**Step 4**
Time to create the loading script to forward the display to XSDL im doing this in putty to ssh to my PI

move to KlipperScreen folder
```
cd ~/KlipperScreen
nano ./launch_klipperscreen.sh
```
paste this code into your nano screen


```
#!/bin/bash
# forward local display :100 to remote display :0
adb tcpip
adb forward tcp:6100 tcp:6000

adb shell dumpsys nfc | grep 'mScreenState=' | grep OFF_LOCKED > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -lt 1 ]
then
    echo "Screen is OFF and Locked. Turning screen on..."
    adb shell input keyevent 26
fi

adb shell dumpsys nfc | grep 'mScreenState=' | grep ON_LOCKED> /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -lt 1 ]
then
    echo "Screen is Locked. Unlocking..."
    adb shell input keyevent 82
fi

# start xsdl
adb shell am start-activity x.org.server/.MainActivity

ret=1
timeout=0
echo -n "Waiting for x-server to be ready "
while [ $ret -gt 0 ] && [ $timeout -lt 60 ]
do
    xset -display :100 -q > /dev/null 2>&1
    ret=$?
    timeout=$( expr $timeout + 1 )
    echo -n "." 
    sleep 1
done
echo ""
if [ $timeout -lt 60 ]
then
    DISPLAY=:100 /home/pi/.KlipperScreen-env/bin/python3 /home/pi/KlipperScreen/screen.py
    exit 0
else
    exit 1
fi
```
Save Buffer by "Ctrl X" then yes
now run
```
sudo chmod +x ./launch_klipperscreen.sh
```
this is nessessary to make our script executable

**Step 5**
test the screen output by running the script
```
./launch_klipperscreen.sh
```
this is to verify a few items 
1. that the screen actually works 
2. to determine whether or not KlipperScreen is connecting to the printer

If your screen works and connects to the printer
AWESOME move onto step 6 there is nothing further for you to do

if your screen works and does not connect to the printer we need to retrieve the API Key
- this is normally caused by logins being enabled on the Fluidd UI this is an easy hurdle however
- retrieve your API key and place in a Configuration file
    
    
    example code Save in klipper_config (/home/pi/klipper_config/KlipperScreen.conf)
    ```
    # Define printer and name. Name is anything after the first printer word
    [printer yourprintername]  
    # Define the moonraker host/port if different from 127.0.0.1 and 7125
    moonraker_host: 127.0.0.1
    moonraker_port: 7125
    # Moonraker API key if this is not connecting from a trusted client IP
    moonraker_api_key: 
    #~# --- Do not edit below this line. This section is auto generated --- #~#
    
    #~#
    #~# [main]
    #~# screen_blanking = off
    #~# theme = material-dark
    #~# confirm_estop = True
    #~#
    ```
    now kill the script by pressing Ctrl C twice
    
**Step 6**
Now its time to setup the Script as a system service that survives throughout reboots
look at example.service in data folder that is word for work what you need in your file i have it listed as i am going to be compiling an autoscript

time to go to the Systemd
```
cd /etc/systemd/system
```
now time to create file
```
sudo nano ./KlippyScreenAndroid.service
```
paste in nano
```
[Unit]
Description=KlippyScreen
After=moonraker.service
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/KlipperScreen
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash  /home/pi/KlipperScreen/launch_klipperscreen.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
save, now time to enable and reload services
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable KlippyScreenAndroid
sudo systemctl restart KlippyScreenAndroid
```
Now it should be working and no matter what it will run every reboot

Side Note to get working over Wi-Fi instead of USB ADB

Follow all steps Skip 3 and put this code in script instead under Step 4
```
#!/bin/bash
DISPLAY=(your ip from blue screen):0 /home/pi/.KlipperScreen-env/bin/python3 /home/pi/KlipperScreen/screen.py
```
With the Wi-Fi method you can create multiple scripts to push to separate devices however if you lose connection you'll have to restart the service to push to the devices again
